# Data Analysis 
    this part of project has been declared to answer this question: " Is 'nationality' a good for being label of this data?
# Data Analysis : Is Nationality a good feature to be a label?

## first:   with analysis you can find the best dimension reduction to decrease the input data file from almost 780 features to 2 feature for better visulize and           clustering

## second : after finding the best and the most aproprirate algorithm test and try some good clustering algorithm and evaluate them in clustering file to check that is     nationality could be a specifier label or not?

## analysis.ipynb:
    In this file we check that what dimension reduction is the best for the data.csv . 
the options :
1. PCA
2. TNSE
3. UMAP
## clustering.ipynb:
In this part of this section we cluster this data with various algorithms like:
* KMeans
* Agglomerative
* DBSCAN
* Optics
* MiniBatchKmeans
* Brich
* Gaussian_Mixture
